## 🎯 Day 1: Foundation & LLM Provider Configuration

### Project: `hello_agent/`

**Focus**: Understanding LLM Provider Configuration at Different Levels

#### What I Learned:

- **Agent Level Configuration**: How to configure specific LLM providers for individual agents
- **Run Level Configuration**: Setting up providers for specific execution runs
- **Global Level Configuration**: System-wide provider settings
- **Provider Flexibility**: Using OpenAI-compatible APIs with different backends (like Gemini)

#### Key Concepts Mastered:

- `OpenAIChatCompletionsModel` with custom clients
- `RunConfig` for execution-level customization
- `set_default_openai_client()` for global settings
- Async/await patterns in agent execution

#### Code Example:

```python
# Agent Level - Each agent can use different LLM providers
agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="You only respond in haikus.",
    model=OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        openai_client=client
    ),
)
```

#### Key Concepts Mastered:

- Function tool decorators (`@function_tool`)
- Input/output validation and error handling
- Structured logging for tool calls
- Project hygiene with dependency management (`uv`)

### Project: `web_search_tool/`

**Focus**: Real-World Tool Integration & Multi-Tool Reasoning

#### What I Learned:

- **Web Search Integration**: Using Tavily API for real-time information retrieval
- **Multi-Tool Selection**: Agents choosing between different tools based on context
- **Async Web Server**: Building interactive web interfaces for agents
- **Environment Management**: Secure API key handling

#### Key Concepts Mastered:

- Tavily web search integration
- Math function tools (add, subtract, multiply, divide, power)
- Web server with FastAPI/Uvicorn
- Frontend-backend agent communication

#### Advanced Features:

- **Autonomous Tool Selection**: Agent decides when to search vs. calculate vs. answer directly
- **Structured Responses**: JSON-formatted search results
- **Interactive Web UI**: Real-time agent interaction through web interface
